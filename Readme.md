**Project Idea: Demonstration Status Map - Kenya**

Project Overview:
The Demonstration Status Map is a website that allows users to view the status of road demonstrations in Kenya using Google Maps API and curated news sources. The platform will provide real-time information on road demonstrations, enabling users to plan their routes accordingly and stay updated on the latest developments.

Key Features:

1. Interactive Map: The website will display an interactive map of Kenya, powered by Google Maps API, showing the locations of road demonstrations with markers.

2. Demonstration Status:Users can click on the markers to view information about the demonstration, including its status (ongoing, dispersed, scheduled), date, time, and the reason behind the demonstration.

3. Curated News Integration: The website will integrate curated news sources to provide additional context and updates related to road demonstrations. This information will be displayed alongside the map.

4. Search Functionality: Users can search for specific locations or roads to check for demonstrations in their areas of interest.

5. User Alerts: Users can opt-in for email or push notifications to receive real-time updates on road demonstrations in their chosen locations.

Technology Stack:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (Flask or Django)
- Google Maps API for map integration
- News API for curated news integration
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL

Data Collection and Management:

- Road demonstration data will be collected from reliable news sources, government announcements, and social media updates. A web scraper can be used to collect and update data from various sources periodically.
- The data will be stored in a database, including details such as location coordinates, status, date, and reason for the demonstration.

Implementation Strategy:

1. Frontend Development:Develop the frontend of the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrate the Google Maps API to display the interactive map and markers for road demonstrations.

2. Backend Development: Set up the backend using Python with Flask or Django to handle user requests, process data, and provide responses.

3. Data Integration: Integrate the curated news sources using News API to fetch and display relevant news updates related to road demonstrations.

4. Database Management: Implement a database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store road demonstration data, allowing for efficient retrieval and updates.

5. Search Functionality: Implement the search feature, enabling users to search for specific locations or roads and check for demonstrations.

6. User Alerts: Set up a notification system that allows users to subscribe to real-time updates on road demonstrations in their chosen areas.

7. User Interface Design: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the website to enhance user experience.

8. Testing and Deployment: Perform thorough testing to ensure the website's functionality and security. Deploy the website to a web server for public access.

Conclusion:

The Demonstration Status Map website will provide a valuable service to users in Kenya by offering real-time information on road demonstrations, helping them plan their routes and stay informed about potential disruptions. By utilizing Google Maps API and curated news sources, the platform will deliver a reliable and efficient user experience.
